## Overview

In this project, my role as a software engineer was to work closely with the design team to bring their creative vision for Bearified ùïè PAYC to life. Using React, TypeScript, and Next.js, we developed a flexible, component-based architecture that allowed us to translate Figma designs directly into functional, scalable code. The goal was to build a design system that would serve as the foundation for the community-driven future of PAYC, ensuring smooth development while keeping visual consistency across the platform

## Key Features

- **Component-Driven Development**: We built a library of reusable, modular UI components using React, styled-components, and TypeScript. These components were designed to be flexible and responsive, ensuring they would work across different devices and screen sizes without losing functionality or aesthetics.
- **Efficient Design-to-Code Workflow**: Collaborating with designers through Figma, I ensured that design assets were translated into code with high fidelity. This workflow was optimized by syncing Figma tokens directly with the codebase, minimizing discrepancies between design and implementation.
- **Figma Integration**: Worked closely with designers by setting up a shared design library in Figma. This library was synchronized with the codebase, ensuring design handoffs were seamless and that design tokens remained consistent across both platforms.
- **Documentation and Usage Guidelines**: Developed comprehensive documentation with Storybook to showcase components, usage patterns, and best practices, ensuring the design system is easy to adopt by other teams.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: For fast, server-rendered React applications.
- **Figma**: For creating and managing design assets and prototypes.
- **Styled-Components**: For styling React components with a modular, themable approach.
- **Storybook**: For building an interactive, documented component library.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the main challenges was ensuring a smooth integration between design and development, especially when dealing with evolving requirements. Working with Figma allowed us to bridge that gap effectively, but it required careful synchronization between design tokens and the codebase to prevent inconsistencies. Additionally, balancing customization flexibility with design consistency was a key lesson‚Äîestablishing clear guidelines for when and how components could be adapted helped maintain coherence across the platform.

## Outcome

The design system we developed is now the backbone of Bearified ùïè PAYC‚Äôs front-end architecture, supporting a growing set of community-driven projects. The modular components and well-documented codebase have accelerated development times, reduced design discrepancies, and enabled seamless collaboration between designers and developers. This system lays the groundwork for the continued evolution of PAYC as a community-led platform, allowing future teams to build upon a solid, adaptable foundation.

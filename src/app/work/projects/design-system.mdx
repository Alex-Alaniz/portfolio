## Overview

Building multiple products at BearifiedCo requires consistency. The BearifiedLabs Design System provides a shared foundation of components, tokens, and patterns used across all our applications — from Bearified Artifacts to the BEARCO Gaming Platform.

## Key Features

- **Component-Driven Development**: Reusable, modular UI components built with React and styled-components
- **Design Tokens**: Consistent colors, typography, and spacing synced between Figma and code
- **Responsive by Default**: Components work seamlessly across mobile and desktop
- **Documentation**: Storybook-powered component library with usage examples

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: Server-rendered React applications
- **Figma**: Design asset management and prototyping
- **Styled-Components**: Modular, themable styling
- **Storybook**: Interactive component documentation

## Brand Colors

| Color | Hex | Usage |
|-------|-----|-------|
| Orange | `#FF8A00` | Primary brand, buttons, accents |
| Black | `#0C0C0C` | Backgrounds |
| Grey | `#1A1A1A` | Secondary backgrounds, cards |
| Neon Green | `#7CFF4E` | Success states, highlights |

## Component Library

The system includes:
- Layout components (Flex, Grid, Container)
- Form elements (Input, Button, Checkbox, Select)
- Feedback components (Toast, Modal, Alert)
- Data display (Card, Table, Badge)
- Navigation (Header, Footer, Sidebar)

## Challenges & Learnings

The main challenge was ensuring smooth integration between design and development as requirements evolved. We established clear guidelines for component customization that balanced flexibility with consistency, preventing the design system from becoming fragmented across products.

## Outcome

The design system now powers all BearifiedCo products, reducing development time by 40% and ensuring a cohesive user experience. New products can be spun up quickly using existing components, and updates propagate automatically across the ecosystem.

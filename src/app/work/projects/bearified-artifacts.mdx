## Overview

Bearified Artifacts is an AI-powered generation platform that transforms community ideas into visual artifacts. Built with Google Gemini for AI generation and integrated with BEARCO token payments on Solana, it represents the future of community-driven creative tools.

## Key Features

- **AI Artifact Generation**: Powered by Google Gemini for high-quality visual output generation from text prompts
- **BEARCO Token Payments**: Native integration with our Solana token for seamless crypto payments via thirdweb
- **Vote-to-Earn Mechanics**: Community members can vote on submitted ideas and earn rewards for participation
- **Idea Submission System**: Community-driven content where users submit ideas that get transformed into artifacts
- **Live Preview**: Real-time preview of artifacts as they're being generated
- **Archive System**: Persistent database storage for all generated artifacts with Supabase

## Technical Architecture

- **Frontend**: Next.js with React for a responsive, modern UI
- **AI Engine**: Google Gemini API for artifact generation
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) for persistent storage
- **Payments**: thirdweb integration for BEARCO token and multi-currency support
- **Hosting**: Vercel with 60-second function timeouts for long-running generations

## Recent Updates

- Added AI output validation and enhancement layer
- Implemented artifact audit system and user report functionality
- Complete visual redesign with bold futuristic portal lighting effects
- Black Friday pricing: Ideas $3, Generations $2
- Interactive welcome tour for first-time visitors
- Milestone badges integrated into ideas feed

## Challenges & Solutions

The main challenge was synchronizing payment confirmation with AI generation. We solved this by implementing a queue system that triggers artifact generation immediately upon payment verification, ensuring users see their artifacts within seconds of completing payment.

## Outcome

Bearified Artifacts has become a core product of BearifiedCo, demonstrating the power of tokenized software development. Community members actively participate in idea submission and voting, creating a self-sustaining ecosystem of creative content.

## Overview

StablePay brings the simplicity of Venmo to crypto payments. Send stablecoins to anyone using just their username — no wallet addresses to copy, no chain confusion, just simple peer-to-peer payments.

## Key Features

- **Username-Based Payments**: Send USDC/USDT to users by @username, not wallet addresses
- **Multi-Chain Support**: Ethereum, Polygon, and Base with Base as default for lowest fees
- **Email Authentication**: thirdweb user wallets with email verification — no seed phrases needed
- **Smart Balance Filtering**: View balances by chain and token with persistent user preferences
- **Real-Time Tracking**: Transaction status monitoring with blockchain confirmation updates
- **Mobile-First Design**: Venmo-inspired UI optimized for mobile devices

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom Venmo-inspired design system
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) with Row Level Security
- **Blockchain**: thirdweb API v1 for all Web3 operations
- **Authentication**: thirdweb email verification + JWT token management

## Payment Flow

1. **User Search**: Look up recipient by username in Supabase
2. **Payment Creation**: Call thirdweb `/v1/payments` endpoint
3. **Payment Execution**: Complete via `/v1/payments/{id}` endpoint
4. **Transaction Recording**: Store details in Supabase
5. **Real-time Updates**: Status updates via Supabase subscriptions

## Supported Networks

| Network | Token | Gas Currency |
|---------|-------|--------------|
| Base (Default) | USDC | ETH |
| Ethereum | USDC | ETH |
| Polygon | USDC | MATIC |

## Challenges & Solutions

The biggest challenge was preventing infinite re-render loops in React when dealing with real-time balance updates. We solved this through careful use of `useCallback` and `useMemo` hooks with proper dependency arrays, ensuring the UI remains responsive without unnecessary re-renders.

## Outcome

StablePay demonstrates how crypto payments can be as simple as traditional peer-to-peer apps. The username-based system removes the friction of wallet addresses while multi-chain support gives users flexibility in how they transact.

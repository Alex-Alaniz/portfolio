AI isn't just a coding assistant anymore — it's becoming the primary developer. Here's how I built an autonomous coding workflow that ships real products.

## The Setup

The workflow runs on Claude Opus 4.5, the most capable model for complex reasoning and code generation. But the magic isn't in the model — it's in the orchestration.

## Key Components

### Session Management

Each coding session maintains state across multiple invocations. The system tracks:

- Current task context
- Files modified
- Tests run
- Errors encountered

This allows Claude to pick up exactly where it left off, even across machine restarts.

### Multi-Machine Coordination

Running on multiple machines simultaneously required solving coordination problems:

- Shared task queues via Redis
- Lock mechanisms for file modifications
- Progress synchronization

### Autonomous Task Generation

The system doesn't just execute tasks — it generates them. Given a high-level goal like "implement user authentication," Claude breaks it down into:

1. Database schema design
2. API endpoint implementation
3. Frontend integration
4. Test coverage
5. Documentation

Each sub-task is executed autonomously.

## Production Hardening

Getting this to run reliably in production required:

- **Retry logic** for API failures
- **Health checks** for session monitoring
- **One-click startup** scripts
- **Automatic recovery** from errors

## Results

The workflow now handles significant portions of BearifiedCo development. It's particularly effective for:

- CRUD operations
- API integrations
- Test writing
- Documentation

Human oversight is still essential for architecture decisions and complex business logic. But the mundane work? That's automated.

## The Future

This is just the beginning. As models improve, the autonomous capability will expand. The goal isn't to replace developers — it's to amplify them.

Imagine a future where you describe what you want built, and it just... gets built. We're closer than you think.
